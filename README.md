firebaseHackathon
=================

8/14
 This is what I made during a 2-hour firebase hackathon last Thursday. Whatever is entered to the text box
 shows up for all users. And whenever anyone presses the button, it will wrap the text in a script tag
 and add it to the document. Hosted at http://scorching-fire-6194.firebaseapp.com.
